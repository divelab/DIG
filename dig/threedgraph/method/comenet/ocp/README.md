ComENet OC20 IS2RE Performance ("All" dataset, direct energy predictions, no pretraining or auxiliary task)
![OC20 IS2RE Performance](ComENetIS2REResults.jpg)
ComENet can be trained in under 20 minutes per epoch on a single NVIDIA 2080ti GPU and predictions
take less than one minute per test/validation split.
